    "* It is possible to either assign each point, line, etc. a variable name, or store them as items in a list and call them by index\n",
    "* Where points and line segments need to be ordered when generating lines and line loops, respectively, the surfaces making up a *water-tight* shell do not need to be ordered to create a volume.\n",
    "* As said before, surfaces forming the volume shell should be watertight, a word that comes from the analogy that if the shell is filled with water, nothing should leak out.\n",
    "* Surface elements (the triangles, in `.stl` case) should connect but not overlap.\n",
    "    * This initially went wrong when generating the volume from the `.stl` triangles. I set a resolution to the points - making it different from the original resolution - and this is no problem when generating a bag of triangles which is what happens up until the `add_surface()` commands. But if I then want to merge those triangles into a volume, their sizes (= resolution) don't add up because there is an equal number of triangles as in the old mesh but the sizes are different. We get overlapping triangles, and this causes overlapping 3D cells and thus an error when calling `add_volume()`.
